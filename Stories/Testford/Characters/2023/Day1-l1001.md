## New Perspectives

Marcus adjusts his glasses as he studies the view from Penny Farm toward the village square, sketchbook balanced on his knee. Three days in Fableford and already the competing rhythms of the place fascinate him.

The newly built Willow Court complex where he's renting feels alien against the backdrop of thatched roofs and weathered stone. He sketches the sightline, adding notes about visual integration and transitional spaces in precise handwriting.

"Three weeks before the job starts," he murmurs to himself. "Enough time to understand what makes this place tick."

His research had revealed the statistics and development plans, but numbers couldn't capture the subtle social geography—the way residents from the square glance at his Penny Farm address (or "Bottom-ford" as he's heard them call it) with barely concealed judgment, or how the church spire dominates not just the skyline but seemingly the village's self-image.

Marcus closes his sketchbook and stands, stretching. The OTIQ project will fundamentally alter Fableford's relationship with the surrounding region. His experience in Manchester taught him that the best developments honor a community's character while enabling its evolution.
