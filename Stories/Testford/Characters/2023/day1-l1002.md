## Research Materials

Marcus pushes open the door to Turning Pages bookshop, the bell's chime interrupting the peaceful quiet. His research on Testford had revealed this recently reopened establishment, potentially a valuable resource for understanding the village's identity before his project begins.

The shop feels meticulously arranged despite hints of ongoing restoration. His trained eye immediately evaluates the space—good traffic flow, thoughtful use of limited square footage, natural light maximized by the window displays. Someone with an intuitive grasp of spatial dynamics runs this place.

A woman with silver-streaked dark hair in a loose bun looks up from dusting books. Her intelligent gray eyes behind tortoiseshell glasses assess him with subtle curiosity.

"Can I help you find anything?" she asks.

"I'm looking for resources on Oxfordshire history," Marcus responds, precisely articulating his needs. "Particularly anything that might include information about Testford and the surrounding area's development."

She guides him to a modest but well-curated regional history section. Her knowledge of the inventory suggests personal investment rather than casual employment.

"Regional history is just here. Not extensive, I'm afraid, but there's Hargreaves' 'Chronicles of Rural Oxfordshire' that includes a chapter on Testford and neighboring villages. There's also Pemberley's 'Architectural Heritage of the Thames Valley' that mentions some of our older buildings."

The books appear promising—understanding historical development patterns would provide context for his integration planning. Marcus notes her careful handling of the volumes, a characteristic he respects.

"I'm Eleanor Frost," she introduces herself. "I reopened Turning Pages recently after returning to Testford."

"Marcus Chen," he offers with professional courtesy. "Urban planner. Just moved to the area for a project."

A subtle shift in her expression suggests she's connected his profession to the OTIQ development. Interesting—he'll need to understand local perceptions of the project before his work begins. This bookshop and its owner might provide valuable insights beyond what's in these pages.

He selects three books, calculating their potential utility against his limited apartment shelf space. As she creates his customer account, Marcus makes a mental note to return. Both the shop's resources and its proprietor warrant further investigation.
