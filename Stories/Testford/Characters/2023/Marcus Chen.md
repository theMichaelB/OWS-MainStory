## Brief Description

Marcus is athletically built with a meticulous appearance - crisp button-down shirts with rolled sleeves and dark-framed glasses. His black hair is precisely cut, and he moves with purpose, often carrying a worn leather messenger bag filled with sketches and plans.

## Personality

Marcus is analytical and solution-oriented, approaching problems with methodical precision. He struggles with patience when faced with bureaucracy or resistance to change. Beneath his professional demeanor lies a dry sense of humor and genuine concern for creating spaces that foster community connection.

## Background

After a decade working for a prestigious urban planning firm in Manchester, Marcus accepted a position with the Oxfordshire Council Development Team overseeing aspects of the new Oxfordshire Technology and Innovation Quarter (OTIQ). The son of Chinese immigrants who ran a restaurant in Bristol, he distanced himself from his family traditions during his education and career ascent, something he's beginning to regret. His previous projects have focused on urban revitalization, balancing modernization with historical preservation.

## Current Situation

Marcus has just moved to Fableford's Bottom-ford development, with his new council position not starting for another three weeks. He's using this time to explore the village, understand its character, and settle into his new home. His involvement with OTIQ remains largely unknown to the villagers, giving him an unfiltered view of community sentiments about the development. He's experiencing symptoms of burnout after years of high-pressure projects and is questioning his career choices while hoping this change of environment will provide a fresh perspective.

## Connections

- Potential connection with local bookshop owner through his interest in local history and urban design literature
- Possible tensions with village traditionalists as his role with OTIQ becomes known
- Potential professional relationship with council members and other newcomers connected to the technology quarter
