## Brief Description

Marcus is athletically built with a meticulous appearance - crisp button-down shirts with rolled sleeves and dark-framed glasses. His black hair is precisely cut, and he moves with purpose, often carrying a worn leather messenger bag filled with sketches and plans.

## Personality

Marcus is analytical and solution-oriented, approaching problems with methodical precision. He struggles with patience when faced with bureaucracy or resistance to change. Beneath his professional demeanor lies a dry sense of humor and genuine concern for creating spaces that foster community connection.

## Background

After a decade working for a prestigious urban planning firm in Manchester, Marcus chose Fableford for a change of pace and the opportunity to shape a smaller community. The son of Chinese immigrants who ran a restaurant in Bristol, he distanced himself from his family traditions during his education and career ascent, something he's beginning to regret.

## Current Situation

Marcus is developing proposals for infrastructure improvements around town, facing resistance from traditionalists who fear change. He's experiencing symptoms of burnout after years of high-pressure projects and is questioning his career choices while living in temporary accommodation until he decides whether to stay in Fableford permanently.

## Connections

- Potential professional relationship with town council members evaluating his proposals
- Possible friendship with a local restaurant owner who reminds him of his family
- Tension with historical preservation advocates who oppose his modernization plans
