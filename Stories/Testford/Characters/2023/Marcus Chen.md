## Brief Description

Marcus is athletically built with a meticulous appearance - crisp button-down shirts with rolled sleeves and dark-framed glasses. His black hair is precisely cut, and he moves with purpose, often carrying a worn leather messenger bag filled with sketches and plans.

## Personality

Marcus is analytical and solution-oriented, approaching problems with methodical precision. He struggles with patience when faced with bureaucracy or resistance to change. Beneath his professional demeanor lies a dry sense of humor and genuine concern for creating spaces that foster community connection.

## Background

After a decade working for a prestigious urban planning firm in Manchester, Marcus accepted a position with a regional development agency based in the nearby city. He chose to live in Testford for a change of pace and to experience small-town life while maintaining a short commute to his new office. The son of Chinese immigrants who ran a restaurant in Bristol, he distanced himself from his family traditions during his education and career ascent, something he's beginning to regret.

## Current Situation

Marcus has just moved to Testford, with his new job not starting for another month. He's using this time to explore the town, understand its character, and settle into his new home. He's experiencing symptoms of burnout after years of high-pressure projects and is questioning his career choices while hoping this change of environment will provide a fresh perspective.

## Connections

- Potential connection with local bookshop owner through his interest in local history and urban design literature
- Possible friendship with a local restaurant owner who reminds him of his family
- Potential tension with historical preservation advocates once his work on regional development becomes known
