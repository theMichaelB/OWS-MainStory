## A Curious Customer

Eleanor arranges the urban planning section with methodical precision, wiping dust from neglected spines. Two weeks since reopening Turning Pages, and she's still discovering forgotten corners of inventory.

The bell above the door chimes. A man she doesn't recognize—likely from the new Penny Farm development—enters, his gaze immediately scanning the shop's layout with analytical intensity. Something about his purposeful movement suggests he's searching for something specific.

"Can I help you find anything?" Eleanor asks, placing the feather duster on a nearby shelf.

"I'm looking for resources on Oxfordshire history," he replies, adjusting his dark-framed glasses. "Particularly anything that might include information about Testford and the surrounding area's development."

His crisp button-down and leather messenger bag mark him as a professional, not the typical history enthusiast. Eleanor finds herself intrigued.

"Regional history is just here," she directs him, pointing to the appropriate shelf. "Not extensive, but there's material on the area."

He selects several books, handling them with noticeable care—always a good sign in a customer. and brings them to the register. Another new resident, judging by his mention of just moving to the area. Chen was the surname, she thinks. Marcus, perhaps? Something about urban planning.

"I'm Eleanor Frost," she offers. "I reopened Turning Pages recently after returning to Testford."

"Marcus Chen," he responds with a small, measured smile. "Urban planner. Just moved to the area for a project."

Eleanor's curiosity deepens. A new urban planner in Testford can only mean one thing—the OTIQ development. She wonders which side of the project he represents, but holds back her questions. There will be time for that, she suspects, as he selects two books on local history and one on rural English architecture.
