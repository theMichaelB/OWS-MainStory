# LOCAL AUTHOR NEEDED

Eleanor Frost (Character ID: 2001), owner of "Turning Pages" bookshop, is planning to host author events to support the local literary scene. Looking for a writer to create a local author character who could:

- Have recently published their first novel or collection
- Participate in a book signing/reading event at Turning Pages
- Have meaningful connections to the town of Fableford

This character would help establish the town's creative community and provide opportunities for literary-themed events and discussions.
