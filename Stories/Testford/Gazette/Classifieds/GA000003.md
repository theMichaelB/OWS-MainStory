# SEEKING WRITER FOR ELEANOR'S ESTRANGED DAUGHTER

Character Request: A college-aged young woman (19-22) who is the estranged daughter of Eleanor Frost (Character ID: 2001), owner of "Turning Pages" bookshop.

**Character Details:**
- Daughter of Eleanor Frost, estranged since parents' divorce
- College student, possibly studying something that contrasts with her mother's literary world
- Recently sent a cryptic email suggesting a possible visit to Fableford
- Complex feelings about her mother's choice to leave London and return to her hometown
- Own distinct personality that has developed during years of limited contact with Eleanor

**Narrative Opportunities:**
- Exploration of complicated family dynamics and reconciliation themes
- Potential for both conflict and healing
- Character could have own reasons for coming to Fableford beyond reconnecting with Eleanor
- Rich backstory potential involving family history
