## Willow Court Apartments, #7

A modest one-bedroom apartment in the recently built Willow Court complex, part of the Penny Farm development (locally known as "Bottom-ford") at the northern edge of Fableford. The clean, contemporary architecture stands in stark contrast to the village's historic buildings, with large windows and minimalist design. 

Unit #7 is on the second floor with a small balcony overlooking the development's central landscaped courtyard. Marcus has furnished the space sparsely but purposefullyâ€”a drafting table positioned by the main window serves as his workspace, while architectural books and journals are meticulously organized on floating shelves. The walls remain mostly bare except for a few framed urban planning schematics and a single traditional Chinese ink painting that was a gift from his mother.

The open-plan living area transitions seamlessly into a compact kitchen with sleek appliances. Despite having moved in only recently, Marcus maintains an orderly space with everything in its designated place. The apartment's clinical modernity is softened only by the afternoon light that floods through the western windows and the small collection of potted plants arranged precisely on the balcony.
