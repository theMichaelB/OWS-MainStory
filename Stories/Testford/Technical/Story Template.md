## Story Title


Brief story text - approximately 100-300 words maximum. Focus on:


- Clear, direct writing
- Key character actions and decisions
- Essential dialogue only
- Hooks for potential character interactions
- Maintaining consistent character voice

Stories should be readable in 1-2 minutes and clearly advance either character development or plot.
