# BOOKSHOP OWNER SEEKING CONNECTIONS

Eleanor Frost (Character ID: 2001), the new owner of "Turning Pages" bookshop, is looking to establish connections within the Fableford community. As a recent returnee to town after fifteen years away, Eleanor is eager to:

- Meet fellow small business owners (especially caf√© proprietors interested in possible book club collaborations)
- Connect with local writers or journalists who might be interested in hosting or covering literary events
- Encounter neighbors and regular customers who might become fixtures in her shop

Eleanor is particularly focused on revitalizing the town's literary scene and supporting local authors, though she tends to be reserved until she gets to know people. Her bookshop could serve as a natural meeting place for characters interested in literature, community events, or simply enjoying a quiet space.

*Writer's Note: Open to both casual interactions and more complex relationship development. Particularly interested in characters who might challenge Eleanor's tendency to keep people at arm's length.*
