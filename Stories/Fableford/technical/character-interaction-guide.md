## Core Principle: Every Character Exists


One of the core principles of Fableford is that every character exists independently. A reader should be able to follow the story of any character in any interaction that occurs. Characters will naturally have relations and friends outside of the established world, but care needs to be taken to ensure that these ancillary connections aren't inadvertently brought to life within the narrative. These guidelines ensure that readers don't become invested in a character they can't explore.

This leads to one of the most challenging aspects of writing in this world: **you cannot create characters as plot devices**. If you want your character to interact with other characters, you need to connect with other writers and create a story together. This puts collaboration at the heart of every story and gives readers a genuine choice in finding their own path through the narrative.

## The Hearsay Principle


In Fableford, non-profiled individuals cannot exist within the narrative world itself. They may only be referenced through hearsay, memory, or distant communication - never as present entities within scenes.

### What Makes a Character "Real"?


In Fableford, a character is considered to "exist" only when:


- They have a complete character profile
- They have a dedicated writer responsible for their development
- They've been approved through the proper creation/adoption channels

### The Cardinal Rule


**No character can be named, described in detail, directly interact with, or even be present in the same scene as profiled characters unless they themselves have a dedicated writer and profile.** There are no exceptions to this rule.

## Acceptable References: Hearsay Only


When referencing non-profiled connections, they can only exist through vague hearsay, distant communication, or memory - never as present entities in the scene.

### Acceptable Hearsay References

- **Distant Communication**: "Eleanor received an email from her publisher in London."
- **Mentions in Conversation**: "Eleanor told Alice about her childhood in Devon."
- **Memories**: "She recalled her professor's advice about classic literature."
- **Indirect Knowledge**: "According to the morning news, the mayor had announced budget cuts."
- **Abstract References**: "Her readers often requested more mystery novels."

### Problematic References to Avoid

- **Physical Presence**: "Customers browsed the bookshop while Eleanor organized displays."
- **Direct Interaction**: "The delivery person handed her the package with a smile."
- **Naming Individuals**: "John, her assistant, organized the book shipment."
- **Specific Dialogue**: "Her mother called to say she'd visit next weekend."
- **Detailed Descriptions**: "The tall barista with the red hair always remembered her order."
- **Recurring Non-Profiled Characters**: "She always chatted with the friendly postal worker."
- **Scene Setting With People**: "The busy café was filled with morning commuters."

## Managing Character Relationships


### The Empty World Principle


In Fableford, the narrative world is essentially "empty" except for profiled characters. There are no extras, background characters, or unnamed people populating scenes. If your character enters a bookshop, it's empty unless another profiled character is present.

### Family Connections


Family members present a particular challenge as they're often integral to a character's background. Options for handling family include:


1. **Reference Through Communication**: "Eleanor read her mother's letter about family matters."
2. **Submit Character Requests**: Create opportunities for other writers to develop these roles.
3. **Establish Prior Estrangement**: Create narrative reasons why some connections are distant.
4. **Focus on Established Characters**: Build chosen family among existing characters.

### Professional Relationships


For workplace settings and professional interactions:


1. **Remote Communication**: "An email from her editor requested changes to the manuscript."
2. **Mentioned In Conversation**: "Eleanor told Sophie about her publishing team in London."
3. **Past Experiences**: "Her years at the publishing house had taught her persistence."
4. **Institutional Abstractions**: "The university's requirements were outlined in the guidebook."

## Collaborative Storytelling Solutions


### Character Request System


When you need a specific character role filled:


1. Submit a character request through the official channel
2. Describe the role and character needs without naming or detailing the character
3. Wait for another writer to adopt this role before developing related storylines

### Adapting Your Narrative Approach


Rather than relying on background characters:


1. **Utilize Established Settings**: Public spaces where characters naturally interact
2. **Create Events**: Organize situations that bring existing characters together
3. **Develop Relationships**: Focus on deepening connections with established characters
4. **Embrace Constraints**: Use the limitation as a creative challenge

## Examples of Reworking Narratives


### Instead of Creating a Store Clerk...


**Problematic Approach:**  
"Eleanor chatted with Mike, the friendly clerk at the grocery store, about the upcoming festival."

**Better Approaches:**


- "Eleanor noticed a festival flyer while shopping for groceries in the empty store."
- "In her email to Sophie, Eleanor mentioned seeing festival preparations at the grocery store."
- Collaborate with another writer whose character works in retail
- Create a situation where Eleanor meets an established character while shopping

### Instead of Creating Background Characters...


**Problematic Approach:**  
"The café was bustling with the morning crowd as Eleanor found a quiet corner to work."

**Better Approaches:**


- "Eleanor enjoyed the quiet solitude of the empty café as she worked on her manuscript."
- "Eleanor mentioned to Alice how peaceful the café was in the mornings."
- "The café's ambiance was perfect for Eleanor's writing session."

### Instead of Referencing Family Drama...


**Problematic Approach:**  
"Eleanor's sister called to complain about their mother's health decisions."

**Better Approaches:**


- "Eleanor received a frustrating call from home about family matters."
- Submit a character request for a family member role
- Develop a surrogate family dynamic with established characters

## Creative Opportunities


This limitation creates unique storytelling opportunities:


1. **Authentic Community Building**: Characters form genuine connections rather than interacting with disposable NPCs
2. **Unexpected Plot Developments**: Collaboration leads to story directions you might never have conceived alone
3. **Reader Agency**: Every character offers a legitimate path for readers to explore the world
4. **Narrative Depth**: Characters become fully realized rather than serving as plot devices

## Common Questions


**Q: Can my character talk about her childhood friend?**  
A: Yes, but only as a distant reference: "Eleanor told Sophie about her childhood friend from Devon."

**Q: How do I describe public places without populating them?**  
A: Focus on the environment, not people: "The café's comfortable chairs and soft music created a perfect writing atmosphere."

**Q: What about businesses and services?**  
A: Reference the service, not service providers: "Eleanor had her groceries delivered on Tuesday."

**Q: Can I mention my character attended a family funeral?**  
A: Yes, as distant information: "Eleanor had recently returned from a family funeral, as she mentioned in her email to Alice."

**Q: How do I describe a character's work without colleagues?**  
A: Focus on the work product and communications: "Eleanor reviewed manuscript submissions all afternoon."

## Embracing the Collaborative Heart of Fableford


Fableford is like no other writing experience. Each character has a life that needs to be developed and grown over time. Every character starts as an unknown. The only way to grow your character is to make connections with other writers and build stories together. Over time you will develop a peer group of collaborators where you build and grow each other's stories.

What initially seems like a constraint becomes the defining feature that makes Fableford special. The absence of disposable background characters forces meaningful connections between fully-realized characters. Each interaction carries weight and purpose. Each relationship develops organically through collaboration between writers who care deeply about their characters' journeys.

For us, this is what social media should be—people helping people to be better, building something collectively magnificent that no single person could achieve alone. A place where you don't have a friend count, you have friends. Friends you have genuine interactions with, friends you trust and rely on, friends you actually want to see a message from.
