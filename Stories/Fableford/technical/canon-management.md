## Overview


The Fableford Canon Management System helps maintain narrative consistency while preserving creative freedom. This system expands upon the existing Time Canon and Non-Time Canon concepts to address broader world-building elements.

## Canon vs. Non-Canon Content


### Canon Content

- Adheres to the established rules of Fableford's setting (modern-day England)
- Maintains internal consistency with existing canon stories and world elements
- Follows the physics, technology, and societal norms of our contemporary world
- Is prominently featured in discovery mechanisms and recommended reading paths

### Non-Canon Content

- May introduce elements that contradict established world-building (e.g., dragons, magic, futuristic technology)
- Offers creative exploration beyond the core Fableford experience
- Can be enjoyed as alternative interpretations or "what-if" scenarios
- Is still accessible but clearly marked as separate from the main narrative

## Canon Enforcement Process


### Writer Responsibility

- Writers self-designate their content as canon or non-canon upon submission
- When creating canon content, writers should review relevant world-building materials
- Writers can request clarification on canon elements through the community forum

### Community Oversight

- Readers and other writers can flag potential canon violations
- Canon concerns are reviewed by a designated peer group of experienced writers
- Feedback is provided constructively with suggestions for resolution

### AI Assistance

- An automated system scans new submissions to identify potential canon discrepancies
- Writers receive notifications about possible issues before publication
- The AI system improves over time as it learns from human feedback

## Canon Violation Examples


Content that would typically be marked non-canon includes:


- Introduction of supernatural elements (magic, mythical creatures, paranormal abilities)
- Significant alterations to Fableford's geography or established locations
- Futuristic or anachronistic technology beyond current real-world capabilities
- Major historical events that contradict established Fableford history

## Canon Transition Process


Particularly compelling non-canon elements may occasionally be incorporated into the main canon through:


1. Community discussion and voting
2. Integration planning by involved writers
3. Official announcement and documentation updates

## Visual Identification

- Canon content appears with standard formatting
- Non-canon content features distinct visual indicators (alternative background color, badge, or section)
- Filtering options allow readers to include or exclude non-canon content based on preference

This system allows Fableford to maintain narrative coherence while encouraging creative exploration and experimentation. Both canon and non-canon content contribute valuable perspectives to the overall Fableford experience, with clear distinctions helping readers navigate the world according to their preferences.
