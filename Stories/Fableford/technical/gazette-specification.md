## Overview


The Fableford Gazette serves as both an in-world publication and a meta-level community coordination tool within the Fableford platform. This document outlines its purpose, structure, and implementation plan for supporting the collaborative storytelling mechanics of the Fableford platform.

## Purpose & Goals


The Fableford Gazette has two primary functions:


1. **In-World Narrative Element**: As a fictional newspaper within the town of Fableford, providing a sense of community and shared information space for characters.
2. **Meta-Level Coordination Tool**: As a platform mechanism for writers to find collaboration opportunities, request character creation, and coordinate narrative development.

## Implementation Phases


### Phase 1: Community Coordination Tool


In the initial implementation, the Gazette will primarily serve as a coordination mechanism with the following sections:

#### Classifieds Section

- **Collaboration Wanted**: Characters (writers) seeking interaction opportunities with other characters
- **Character Requests**: Writers requesting the creation of specific character types needed for their narrative development (can be fulfilled by any interested writer)
- **Character Relationships**: Requests for writers to create specific characters with established relationships to existing characters (family members, close colleagues, etc.) that require approval by the requesting writer to ensure narrative alignment

#### Community Bulletin Board

- **Upcoming Events**: In-world events that could serve as meeting grounds for multiple characters
- **Location Spotlights**: Highlighting specific locations within Fableford where character interactions could naturally occur

#### Technical Announcements

- **System Updates**: Information about changes to the Fableford platform
- **Writer Guidelines**: Reminders about collaboration protocols and narrative consistency requirements

### Phase 2: Front Page Development


As the Fableford implementation matures, the Gazette will evolve to become an entry point for new readers and writers with these additional features:

#### News Articles

- **Character-Focused Stories**: News reports about significant character activities, written in journalistic style
- **Event Coverage**: Reportage of in-world events that involved multiple characters
- **Community Updates**: Changes to the town of Fableford itself as the shared world evolves

#### Editorial Content

- **Opinion Pieces**: In-character editorials reflecting on town matters
- **Letters to the Editor**: A mechanism for characters to publicly express views that might spark interactions

## Technical Implementation


### Publication Format

- Each issue of the Gazette will be created as a properly formatted Markdown document
- Front matter will include issue number, publication date, and contributing writers
- Cross-references to character profiles and stories will use the established linking conventions

### Integration with Character Stories

- News articles may reference events from character stories, providing alternative perspectives
- Characters may reference "reading something in the Gazette" as plot development

### Automated Content Generation

- The Gazette may initially include some editorially curated content
- The system will analyze existing character profiles and stories to identify potential collaboration opportunities
- Automatically generated classified ads will help foster connections between character narratives

## Moderation & Curation


To ensure the Gazette supports the goals of the Fableford implementation:


1. **Content Relevance**: All Gazette content must serve either narrative development or writer collaboration
2. **Consistency Enforcement**: All news articles must align with established canon and temporal continuity
3. **Character Integrity**: References to characters must respect their established profiles and development arcs
4. **Balanced Coverage**: The Gazette should provide opportunities for all characters, avoiding focus on a small subset

## Reader Experience


For readers navigating the Fableford implementation:


1. **Entry Point**: The Gazette provides a natural starting point for exploring the world of Fableford
2. **Discovery Mechanism**: Readers can discover characters and stories that interest them through Gazette coverage
3. **Contextual Framework**: The Gazette helps readers understand the broader community context of individual character stories

## Writer Experience


For writers participating in the Fableford implementation:


1. **Collaboration Tool**: The Gazette facilitates finding appropriate character interactions
2. **Community Awareness**: Writers can stay informed about narrative developments affecting the shared world
3. **Inspiration Source**: Classified ads and news stories may spark ideas for character development

## Success Criteria


The Fableford Gazette will be considered successful when it:


1. Effectively facilitates writer collaboration through the classifieds system
2. Maintains narrative consistency across character stories through proper reporting
3. Provides a functional entry point for new readers to discover stories
4. Enhances the sense of a shared, living world among separate character narratives
5. Supports the core collaborative storytelling mechanics of the Fableford platform

## Future Development


As the Fableford implementation proves successful concepts, the Gazette may evolve to include:


1. **Specialized Sections**: Sports, arts, business, and other topical sections reflecting community interests
2. **Recurring Columnists**: Regular features written by specific in-world characters
3. **Interactive Elements**: Polls, contests, and other engagement features
4. **Visual Components**: Incorporation of AI-generated images to represent "photographs" within news stories
