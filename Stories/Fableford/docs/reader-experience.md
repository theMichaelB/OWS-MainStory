**The Open World Stories Reading Experience: A Universe of Choices**

Imagine a world of stories so vast and interconnected that you could spend a lifetime exploring its depths and still only scratch the surface. This is the reading experience we're creating with Open World Stories.

**A Boundless Tapestry of Narratives**

With up to a thousand writers in the initial beta, even if they only contribute a thousand words per week (let's be honest, most writers will struggle to write so little), collaboratively, Open World Stories' writers will create a massive number of stories, collected under an immense narrative. The goal is to create vastly more stories than can be read. To create a magnificent, interconnected, complicated, and beautiful story that never ends.

**Forge Your Own Path**

No single reader could possibly keep up with every story in Fableford and the worlds to come. Instead, you'll be empowered to define your own unique path through the narrative landscape. You might:


- **Follow a Single Character:** Become deeply invested in the journey of a particular character, following their story from beginning to end and experiencing the world through their eyes.
- **Explore a Peer Group:** Focus on a group of interconnected characters, witnessing their relationships evolve and their stories intertwine.
- **Trace a Theme:** Follow a specific theme or topic that interests you, jumping between different characters and storylines that explore that theme.
- **Wander and Discover:** Let serendipity guide you, clicking on intriguing links and stumbling upon unexpected narratives that capture your imagination.
- **Curate Your Experience:** Use the platform's tools and features to filter stories by genre, character, content warnings, or other criteria, creating a personalised reading list that aligns with your interests.

**More Than Just Reading**

The Open World Stories experience goes beyond passive consumption. You'll be an active participant in the world, able to:


- **Rate and Comment:** Share your thoughts and reactions to stories, providing valuable feedback to writers and engaging in discussions with fellow readers.
- **Connect with Writers:** Interact with the writers behind the characters, gaining insights into their creative process and influencing the direction of the stories.
- **Shape the World:** Participate in polls, surveys, or community events that influence the development of the world and its characters.
- **Support Writers Financially:** Show your appreciation for the writers and help sustain the Open World Stories ecosystem by contributing financially. You can:
	- **Sponsor a Writer:** Directly sponsor a writer whose work you particularly enjoy, providing them with ongoing support for their creative endeavors.
	- **Make Monthly Contributions:** Contribute a monthly sum that will be distributed among the writers whose stories you've read and enjoyed.
	- **Pay a Monthly Fee:** Opt for a monthly fee that grants you perks and benefits within the community while supporting all the writers.

**A World of Endless Possibilities**

The sheer volume of stories in Open World Stories creates a unique and dynamic reading experience. You'll encounter:


- **Unpredictable Twists and Turns:** As characters' lives intersect and storylines collide, you'll be constantly surprised by unexpected developments and emergent narratives.
- **Hidden Gems:** You'll discover hidden gems and niche stories that might have gone unnoticed in a traditional publishing model.
- **A Sense of Community:** You'll become part of a vibrant community of readers and writers who share a passion for collaborative storytelling.
