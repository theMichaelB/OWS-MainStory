**Empowering Writers, Simplifying Publishing**

Open World Stories aims to revolutionise creative writing by making it profitable and accessible for everyone. We're building a platform that removes the complexities of traditional publishing and empowers writers to share their work with a wide audience while earning fair compensation for their creativity.

**Copyright Assignment and Licensing**

To achieve this vision and facilitate licensing opportunities, Open World Stories requires writers to grant the platform the copyright to all works published on the platform. This allows us to act as an agent for the writers, representing their interests and securing the best possible deals for their creations.

**Creative Commons License**

Upon assignment of copyright, Open World Stories will apply a "Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International" license to all published works. This license:


- **Attribution:** Ensures that writers are always credited for their work.
- **NonCommercial:** Prevents others from using the work for commercial purposes without permission.
- **ShareAlike:** Allows others to remix, adapt, and build upon the work non-commercially, as long as they credit the original author and license their new creations under the identical terms.

**Why This Approach?**

This licensing structure allows Open World Stories to:


- **Act as the sole agent:** We are entrusted with the exclusive right to pursue commercial opportunities for the works, ensuring that writers are fairly compensated for their creative contributions.
- **Protect writers' interests:** The NonCommercial clause prevents unauthorised commercial use of their work.
- **Foster collaboration:** The ShareAlike clause encourages creative remixing and adaptation within the community, while still protecting the original authors' rights.

**Early Implementation**

This copyright and licensing arrangement will be in place from the start of the project. All writers joining Open World Stories will agree to these terms upon registration.

**Benefits for Writers**


- **Simplified Publishing:** Writers can focus on creating without worrying about copyright and licensing complexities.
- **Increased Earning Potential:** Licensing deals can generate significant income for writers, shared fairly and transparently.
- **Creative Control:** Writers retain creative control over their characters and stories.
- **Community Collaboration:** The Creative Commons license fosters a collaborative environment where writers can build upon each other's work.

This licensing arrangement will be discussed in detail with the community during the beta phase. We're committed to gathering feedback and ensuring that all writers understand the terms and benefits. Furthermore, as the project progresses, we'll consult with legal professionals to ensure that the copyright and licensing framework fully protects the interests of both the writers and Open World Stories.

**Open World Stories is committed to creating a sustainable and rewarding ecosystem for writers, where their creativity is valued, and their stories have the potential to reach a global audience.**
