# Platform Monetisation Strategy

## Core Philosophy: Free Access for All

Our platform is built on the principle that quality content should be accessible to everyone, regardless of financial means. Unlike conventional platforms that gate premium features behind paywalls, we're taking a different approach:

- **Equal access for all users**: Everyone receives the full suite of platform features and services
- **No tiered membership levels**: No premium/basic user distinction
- **No feature restrictions**: All tools and capabilities available to every user

## Primary Revenue Streams

### 1. Voluntary Donations

We believe that if we create genuine value, users will support our mission:

- Simple, transparent donation system
- Options for one-time or recurring contributions
- Clear communication about how donations support creators and platform maintenance
- No pressure or degraded experience for non-paying users

### 2. Optional Opt-In Advertising

We're exploring a user-controlled advertising model with these principles:

- **Strict opt-in only**: No ads shown without explicit user consent
- **Privacy-first approach**: No user tracking or data collection
- **No cookies**: Neither first-party nor third-party cookies will be used
- **Transparent policies**: Clear explanation of how the opt-in ad system works

*Note: Our commitment to privacy may limit advertising effectiveness and revenue. We're researching viable approaches that maintain our privacy standards.*

### 3. App Store Distribution

For mobile users, we plan to offer:

- Paid app version available through app stores
- Free version with identical functionality
- Transparent revenue sharing where at least 75% of all income goes directly to creators
- Remaining 25% allocated to platform maintenance and development

## Future Opportunities

As our platform and creator community grows, we envision:

- Acting as agents for promising writers
- Helping to develop and market creator content to wider audiences
- Creating additional revenue opportunities for our most successful creators
- Exploring partnerships that align with our values

## Financial Sustainability

Our current infrastructure planning suggests:

- Day-to-day operating costs can be kept minimal for the foreseeable future
- No immediate need for aggressive monetization
- Ability to maintain an ad-free experience as our default offering
- Sustainable growth model that prioritizes creator success

## Commitment to Transparency

We will regularly share:

- Platform operating costs
- Revenue distribution to creators
- Updates to our monetization strategy
- Community impact of user financial support
