## Overview


Fableford employs organic, human-driven discovery mechanisms that align with our life-first storytelling philosophy. Rather than relying on algorithmic recommendation systems, we enable readers to find stories through natural exploration, community appreciation, and in-world narrative frameworks.

This document outlines the primary discovery mechanisms that help readers navigate the growing world of Fableford while preserving creative serendipity and authentic exploration.

## Core Principles


Our discovery systems are designed around these fundamental principles:


1. **Reader Agency**: Readers choose their own paths rather than following algorithmic suggestions
2. **Narrative Integration**: Discovery tools exist within the story world when possible
3. **Community Wisdom**: Readers help each other find quality content through organic feedback
4. **Diverse Recognition**: We acknowledge many forms of quality beyond simple popularity
5. **Serendipitous Exploration**: Unexpected discoveries are valued and encouraged

## Reader-Generated Appreciation Tags


### Concept


Readers can attach specific appreciation tags to stories they enjoy, creating a community-driven quality signal and discovery system that highlights a story's particular strengths.

### Implementation

1. **Tag Application**
	- After reading, readers can select tags representing what they appreciated
	- Readers can also endorse tags previously applied by others
	- Tags naturally accumulate to indicate community consensus about story strengths
2. **Tag Evolution**
	- The tag ecosystem evolves organically based on reader usage
	- Frequently used tags become more prominent in the interface
	- Rarely used tags are periodically culled (quarterly)
	- Simple sentiment filtering ensures tags remain appreciation-focused
3. **Discovery Interface**
	- Readers can browse stories by tag or tag combinations
	- Tag clouds visualize prominent appreciation patterns
	- Writer profiles show tags frequently associated with their work
	- Related tags suggest new exploration paths

### Benefits

- Provides qualitative feedback beyond simple "likes"
- Creates nuanced discovery paths based on specific story qualities
- Helps readers find writers who excel in aspects they particularly value
- Recognizes diverse forms of quality without reducing to a single metric
- Builds a community-generated vocabulary for discussing storytelling strengths
