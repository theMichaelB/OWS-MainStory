John had been a journalist all of his life. At some point in his life he had written for all of the major newspapers in the UK. He was an investigative journalist during the phone hacking scandal and for the first time in his career he was ashamed to be in the business. 

He moved through a few jobs after that trying to find something that fulfilled him. Ultimately he settled for writing for a small newspaper that measured its readership in tens of thousands rather than millions. He still had some scope to do investigative journalism but he largely considered himself semi-retired and working on a book revealing the secrets of the industry. 

A few weeks before he had watched the mayor launching a new business development incentive. He had regurgitated the press release into an article and had asked around a little to better understand what it was. Over the years John had developed an ear for the words people use. He was never any good at body language etc, but he found that when someone was nervous, or evasive or in some way not being direct and honest then their language would very subtly change. 

As he watched the mayor’s speech he noticed he was lying. He tried to ignore his inner journalist waking up. That lasted almost twenty four hours, then he got to work digging into the project. 

The culmination of that work was a file he had sent to his boss / editor for review before he published. He was waiting in the local coffee shop for him to come talk to him. 

While he was waiting he chatted to [Alice](characters/alice-2024-08-15), asked how she was settling into married life. 

“Oh its amazing!” Said [Alice](characters/alice-2024-08-15), “I was worried that [Sophie](characters/sophie-2024-08-15) wouldn’t like living here away from the big city, and her family. But she’s loving it” 

“Her family are all law enforcement right? This must be quite a change” 

“Yeah, her father is like commissioner Gordon or something” 

John left a pause so [Alice](characters/alice-2024-08-15) would continue talking. His pause was interrupted by a voice behind him. 

“Jamal, get me a coffee while you’re up there” [Tom](characters/tom-2024-08-15) always used John’s native name, that John pretty much never used any more. He particularly disliked the way that he used it. It was a sign that they were both from ‘the old country’ Strangely he only ever mentioned the old country when he wanted something. Him using it as an opening meant that he was here to tell him he couldn’t run the story, and he wanted to be a buddy about it. 

[Alice](characters/alice-2024-08-15) looked at him a little confused. “Jamal?” She had only ever known him as John. 

“A story for another day” he closed his eyes a little and waved his hand “make that two espressos please” 

“No worries” she smiled “go sit down, I’ll bring them over” 

“So I can’t run the story?” John said as he sat down 

“How do you do that? How do you always know what I’m about to say” 

“I’m not sure whether I told you, but I used to be a journalist” said half in jest, and three quarters caustically highlighting his disdain for the stories he had to write for the shitrag he currently had to write for. 

“Then you should know that you’ve not got it” [Tom](characters/tom-2024-08-15) said. “Bring me some more, bring me some evidence that this is happening and you know I’ll support you.”

John stayed silent. 

“Look, some of my other businesses run almost exclusively on government money. I’m not going to attack these people unless it is solid”

John’s silence continued… 

“And this isn’t” 

At that moment, the bell on the door rang, and they were both distracted by the irrefutably fair [Sophie](characters/sophie-2024-08-15) entering the cafe and making a beeline to her new wife. They hug over the counter then she heads to the table along side John’s. 

“They’re corrupt [Tom](characters/tom-2024-08-15), its that simple” John always intentionally didn’t use [Tom](characters/tom-2024-08-15)’s ‘old country name’ because he wasn’t his buddy, he was an employee, and all of his other employees called him Tom

“Come off it Jamal, everybody takes the occasional backhander, its how the world works” 

John saw [Sophie](characters/sophie-2024-08-15) lower her drawing pad a little. [Tom](characters/tom-2024-08-15) was never very good at controlling the volume he spoke at. 

“This is a lot more than that, and you know it. They need to be held accountable” Knowing his words weren’t going to make any difference, but he was acutely aware that he had [Sophie](characters/sophie-2024-08-15)’s attention. 

“Find more, I can’t do anything with this” [Tom](characters/tom-2024-08-15) held the folder in the air, then dropped it on the table. “And get your bloody car fixed, it is a pain in the arse driving all the way out here to you” 

With that he threw his espresso down and left. 

John took out his pocket book, looked at the remains in his cup, watched [Alice](characters/alice-2024-08-15) until she saw him looking and waved his cup in the air to ask for a fresh cup. 

He updated his notes on the corruption case, detailing the conversation he’d just had. He looked at the folder, a flash of concern passed through his mind that [Tom](characters/tom-2024-08-15) had removed something. So he took everything out and spread it across the table. Almost knocking his pocketbook onto the floor, he picked it up and put it on the chair next to his. 

Loathed to concede [Tom](characters/tom-2024-08-15)’s point, he allowed the thought of whether there was enough to pursue the case in these files. 

He was so frustrated, and probably angry, at how the conversation transpired that he was completely shocked when a young woman came and asked if he was John. 

“Yes, what?” He knew he was pulling a confused face, but had no clue who she could be. “Sorry” he took a breath “who are you?” 

“I’m [Jane](characters/jane-2024-08-15), you’re hopefully expecting me for an interview for the graduate journalist position?”

“Oh my! Yes of course, I got myself lost in a story, apologies” he started putting the papers together and pushing them into the folder. “I pulled your articles from your student paper, you write well”

He watched [Jane](characters/jane-2024-08-15) blush a little. 

“Let me ask you” John said “was your editor an arsehole? Because all editors are arseholes” 

“Well thank you” [Jane](characters/jane-2024-08-15) shyly said “But if I get this job, won’t you be my editor?” 

“Exactly my point” John smiled. “Anyway we should get started, do you want a drink?” He looked up to see [Alice](characters/alice-2024-08-15) bringing a cup towards them. 

[Jane](characters/jane-2024-08-15) thanked [Alice](characters/alice-2024-08-15), then looked directly at John “so, is there a story behind that point you just made John” 

“Tell me why you used my name when you asked that Jane” 

“Is that where we’re starting? Surely you know why, I’ve pulled your articles too, you’re very good” [Jane](characters/jane-2024-08-15) said with her very best straight poker face. 

“So, establishing rapport? Developing trust, make me your buddy so I’ll open up” 

“No” she said in a derisory tone. “I was mocking you, obviously”. A moment later she added “I thought somebody with your experience would have known that” 

John leaned back in his seat, let out an audible exaggerated “Ha!” And smiled. 

“Yes [Jane](characters/jane-2024-08-15), this is exactly where we’re starting. Now let me ask you a hypothetical” 

He asked about what she would do if she had evidence of corruption that her editor wouldn’t allow her to publish. 

She laid out the options exactly as he saw them. 

Retrench, find more evidence. Make the story better. 

Go around the editor, is there an owner of the paper. Maybe go to a different paper with the story. 

Take the evidence to the police. Use that investigation to get the scoop. 

Use a contact to pursue the above, if the usual channels don’t work. 

The interview lasted for thirty or so minutes. He was impressed by her. She certainly had a quality. 

All of the contacts he could think of he’d either burnt, they’d died, or it was just too damn long ago to cal in the favours. 

So he’d just have to retrench. He put the folder into his bag and left to go to his home office and get to work. 

As he stood up he accidentally knocked the chair next to him into [Sophie](characters/sophie-2024-08-15). He nodded his head towards her, apologised and left before she could respond.
