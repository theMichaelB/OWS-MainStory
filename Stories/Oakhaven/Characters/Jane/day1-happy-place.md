Jane Potter, she had abandoned her birth name Jane Guðbjørnsdatter, at the start of freshers’ week, it was such a relief to not have to carry the weight of everybody’s confusion. She felt some shame for abandoning her father by no longer using it, but then he had abandoned her a long time ago. 

There are many reasons women have issues with the whole concept of patriachal society. Jane’s was much simpler, she had to carry around this ridiculous name. It always gave her a sense of inner dread whenever there would be any reason for anyone to see her full name. 

So now she was heading towards the M25, with Lily Allen’s Fuck You playing as loudly as her little car’s speakers would play it trying to convince her slightly bruised heart that her (now ex) boyfriend was an asshole anyway. She was leaving him, and leaving Cambridge with all of her possessions stuffed into the back of her 2005 Volkswagen Polo. She was somewhat disappointed that not only did her entire life fit into her little car. But her entire life fitted into her little car with ease. A suitcase for clothes, her prettification shit (make up, hair dryer etc) and a couple of boxes of Knick-knacks. Well, there was also the A4 Manila envelope on the passenger seat containing her 1st in International Relations. She supposed that was quite a big thing. 

Behind the tears that were currently flowing more freely than the M25 ever had, she was excited to be going to Oakhaven. She had missed her Grampa, Grampa Potter, of course - who was intensely proud to see his name on her Cambridge University pass. 

 Her mind wandered to the other reason she was going to Oakhaven, to see John Doyle. The reason she had originally decided to send an application to Cambridge. The reason she had decided to study what she did. The reason she was on her way to her first interview with an actual paper. Albeit a shitty local paper, she knew with her degree she could probably get a placement at a national paper. But j wanted to interview her, and that was pretty damn cool. Or terrifying. 

She checked her face in the mirror, at some point she’d have to stop at some services and sort her face out. She should wait for a while though in case the tears made a reappearance. 

She did find it very peculiar that her interview was in the cafe that was once the hardware store that she spent so many hours in as a little girl helping her Grampa sort out tools and screws and other random hardware. Small world she guessed. “Wouldn’t like to paint it” her (ex) boyfriend whispered into the back of her mind. 

And back came the tears. 

A couple of hours later, she was cleaned up, and parking in the Cafe car park.

She paused before the cafe, nostalgia mingling with delight as she admired its transformed facade. Once a relic of days past, it now glowed in a harmonious blend of pastel greens and blues—a palette both gentle and bold. Perhaps it was the playful name, or the effervescent charm that radiated from every corner, but she couldn’t help feeling enchanted. After all, it was called [The Happy Place](locations/happy-place-cafe).

She spotted [John](characters/john-2024-08-15) sitting by the window, a mess of papers across a double table. Curious, she altered her path so she could walk past the window and peek at what he was doing. It was difficult to pick out any detail, but she could see a newspaper cutting with something about a mayor, and a pile of financial records. “Hello corruption” she mused to herself. 

As she opened the door, a small bell above the door rang. “Of course” she smiled. [John](characters/john-2024-08-15) didn’t look up, he was engrossed in the financial reports.

She stood for a moment, deliberating whether to interrupt, and how. She checked her watch and realised she was a little early. Then got slightly flustered by the bell ringing, and realising she was in the way of the door. 

She excused herself as a tall, strongly featured young woman entered and made her way to the counter, leaning over to embrace the woman behind it. While waiting, her gaze settled on the woman managing the counter, remembering when her grandpa would stand in almost the exact same spot. She smiled again, unsure whether it was his memory, the warm nostalgia of being eight years old, or this woman’s infectious joy that had made the world so perfect right now. 

“Hi, I’m [Alice](characters/alice-2024-08-15), what can I get for you?” [Alice](characters/alice-2024-08-15)’s voice took a moment to make its way through the contentment that Jane was feeling. 

“Sorry, I was…” Jane smiled and moved to the counter, suddenly wishing society allowed her to lean over and hug [Alice](characters/alice-2024-08-15). “Sorry, its been a while since I’ve been here” ok, now she was making it awkward, and needed to explain that “I used to come here when my Grampa ran the place” 

“Oh my! You must be Jane! I have heard so much about you” [Alice](characters/alice-2024-08-15) put the cup down that she was holding, came around the counter, wrapped her arms around Jane and embraced her. “I can’t believe I finally get to meet you” 

Her embrace was warm and gentle, and firm. It was exactly, no, Precisely what she needed after the week that brought her here. She was also in a state of mild emotional overload. “Well, erm, yes, ok, thanks” She returned the embrace and just hung on for a while. 

The surreal moment eventually dissipated, and she was back to standing in front of a counter ordering coffee. [Alice](characters/alice-2024-08-15) told her to take a seat and she’d bring it over. 

Which meant there was nothing else for it, it was time to go and meet her hero. 

She stood in front of his table for a moment, expecting that he’d look up. He didn’t. 

Ok, she’d have to speak, fine, she could manage this - “hi, [John](characters/john-2024-08-15)?” 

He looked up “yes?” 

She was slightly put out that he wasn’t expecting her. But he was working on a story, she figured he had to be somewhat compulsive to be as good as he was. “I’m here for the interview?”

“Oh yes! I’ve been reading your stuff, you’re good” [John](characters/john-2024-08-15) said. 

*You’ve been reading my stuff?* Oh my! John Doyle had read my stuff! Her mind proudly proclaimed. Quickly followed by Oh my! John Doyle has read my stuff. Suddenly all of the late night bad writing she’d done came back to assault her. Her reason stepped in to halt the panic. Of course he’s read my stuff, there’s a link to it on cover letter. Focus now, panic later, her reason instructed her. 

[John](characters/john-2024-08-15) made some comment about his editor being an arsehole. But was interrupted by [Alice](characters/alice-2024-08-15) bringing her coffee. 

“Here you go, and make sure you come back for a chat, I’d love to get to know you a little” [Alice](characters/alice-2024-08-15) said as she put her coffee down. She caught a girlish smile on the strongly featured woman as she made eye contact with [Alice](characters/alice-2024-08-15) before she walked away. 

Jane straightened her cup, and pondered the arsehole comment a little “so [John](characters/john-2024-08-15), what was the point in telling me that?” She immediately noticed [John](characters/john-2024-08-15)’s face change, there was a reaction there, though she couldn’t quite place what it was. Frustration? Anger? 

“Why did you use my name there Jane?” [John](characters/john-2024-08-15) asked

Jane hadn’t actually realised she’d used his name, she was nervous and her mind did weird things. “So is this the start of the interview? If so, then surely you know why, I’ve read your articles too, you’re good enough to know the reasons for these things” 

“Good enough? Really.” Jane felt a prickle of guilt. He'd paused to give it time to surface, and she knew it. “Ok, sure” he continued “Developing trust? Rapport? Make a connection?” 

 

He was mocking her, she recognised the tone from his writing. The look had also gone from his face, he was vaguely smiling again. She replied in kind, “no, of course not, I was mocking you” She hoped he didn’t have a fragile ego as she formed the words. 

He started asking her about a hypothetical case, of a story being blocked by an editor. A story about local government corruption. As he started talking about it she noticed the strongly featured woman to the side of him stop sketching in her book and start paying attention to the conversation. 

It was obviously whatever case he was currently working on, somewhere there was a mayor with some dubious financial records. 

She said what she thought, and the interview carried on for a while. At the end she told [John](characters/john-2024-08-15) she was going to be in town for a week or so, so if he wanted anything else she’d be happy to meet again. They shook hands and Jane left [The Happy Place](locations/happy-place-cafe) to go see her Grampa.
