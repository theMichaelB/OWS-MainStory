**Project Overview:**

Open World Stories is a groundbreaking collaborative creative writing project where every participant shapes a unique character and contributes to a vast, interconnected narrative universe. Imagine a world where every individual, from the central figures of a grand narrative to the shopkeeper on a quiet street, is brought to life by a different writer, each with their own voice and story to tell.

**Core Principles:**


- **Every Character is a Protagonist:** In Open World Stories, you don't just create a character; you embody them. You are responsible for their story, their choices, their growth, and their relationships. Every named character within the world is actively developed by a participating writer. This is what makes the world feel truly alive.
- **One Writer, One Character:** Each character has a unique voice and perspective. Each character has a dedicated writer. This fosters genuine collaboration and creates a rich tapestry of diverse writing styles and personalities.
- **Collaboration is Key:** Open World Stories thrives on interaction. Writers are encouraged to connect, collaborate, and weave their characters' stories together. When you encounter another character in your narrative, you're encountering another writer, leading to organic and dynamic storylines.
- **Structured Freedom with a Core Storyline:** The narrative universe is organized around a central, pre-planned Core Storyline, which can be of **any genre** (e.g., fantasy, sci-fi, romance, thriller, historical fiction).
	- **Tier 1: Core Storyline:** This tier focuses on the central narrative, its main characters (pre-defined Main Characters), and the key events driving the plot. Writers in this tier collaborate closely to ensure a coherent and engaging core narrative. The initial plot points and the general arc of the story are pre-determined by the Core Storyline Team.
	- **Tier 2: Secondary Storylines:** This tier expands the world around the main characters. Tier 1 writers work with other writers who take on Supporting Characters connected to their main character. Every Supporting Character must have a dedicated writer. This writer has the freedom to develop their character's life and personality, provided they maintain the pre-agreed relationship with their Tier 1 character and avoid any actions that would disrupt the Core Storyline.
	- **Tier 3: The World at Large:** This tier is the heart of Open World Stories. It offers boundless creative freedom and limitless possibilities. Writers create independent stories and characters that exist within the same shared world. They are the real world behind main story. As the characters exist in the world their stories intersect with other characters. Every scene is a collaboration between writers building a world for their characters to come alive in.

**Reader Experience:**

Open World Stories offers a unique and immersive reading experience:


- **Multiple Perspectives:** Experience the unfolding narrative and the world at large from countless viewpoints. Every character you encounter is a doorway to a new story.
- **A Living World:** Dive into a dynamic universe populated by individuals, each with their own motivations, secrets, and dreams. Every interaction, every chance encounter, could lead you down a rabbit hole into a completely new and unexpected story.
- **Choose Your Own Adventure:** Follow the main characters in the Core Storyline, explore the lives of those connected to them, or venture into the independent stories of the wider world. The choice is yours. You may find compelling stories without ever encountering the Core or Secondary storylines.

**Joining the World:**

To participate in Open World Stories, you will:


1. **Claim or Create a Character:**
	- **Tier 1 (Core Storyline):** Writers interested in portraying a pre-defined Main Character in the Core Storyline will undergo a selection process. This may involve submitting writing samples, outlining their vision for the character, and potentially participating in community voting. The Core Storyline Team will make the final selection, ensuring the writer is a good fit for the character and the collaborative nature of the project.
	- **Tier 2 (Secondary Storyline):** Tier 1 writers, in collaboration with the Core Storyline Team, may identify "character vacancies" for Supporting Characters within their storylines. Writers can express their interest in these roles, and the Tier 1 writer, potentially with input from the Core Storyline Team, will select the most suitable collaborator.
	- **Tier 3 (The World at Large):** Writers have complete freedom to create their own unique characters within this tier. Simply create a character profile and begin writing! Every named character, or character that interacts within a scene must have a dedicated writer.
2. **Develop Your Character:** Craft their backstory, personality, relationships, and ongoing narrative.
3. **Collaborate with Others:** Connect with fellow writers to weave your characters' stories together, creating a vibrant and interconnected world.
4. **Shape the Universe:** Your choices and actions will contribute to the ever-evolving tapestry of Open World Stories. The stories you create in Tier 3 are not just additions to the world; they *are* the world. Every character you introduce has the potential to become a major point of interest for readers, showcasing the interconnected nature of Open World Stories.

**Open World Stories is more than just a writing project; it's a community. It's a chance to connect with fellow writers, build a world together, and create a truly unique and unforgettable storytelling experience. Join us and bring your character to life!**
