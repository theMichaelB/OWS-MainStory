**Project Overview:**

Open World Stories is a groundbreaking collaborative creative writing project where every participant shapes a unique character and contributes to a vast, interconnected narrative universe. Imagine a world where every individual, from the central figures of a grand narrative to the shopkeeper on a quiet street, is brought to life by a different writer, each with their own voice and story to tell.

**Core Principles:**


- **Every Character is a Protagonist:** In Open World Stories, you don't just create a character; you embody them. You are responsible for their story, their choices, their growth, and their relationships. Every named character within the world is actively developed by a participating writer. This is what makes the world feel truly alive.
- **One Writer, One Character:** Each character has a unique voice and perspective. Each character has a dedicated writer. This fosters genuine collaboration and creates a rich tapestry of diverse writing styles and personalities.
- **Collaboration is Key:** Open World Stories thrives on interaction. Writers are encouraged to connect, collaborate, and weave their characters' stories together. When you encounter another character in your narrative, you're encountering another writer, leading to organic and dynamic storylines.
- **Structured Freedom with a Core Storyline:** The narrative universe is organized around a central, pre-planned Core Storyline, which can be of **any genre** (e.g., fantasy, sci-fi, romance, thriller, historical fiction).
	- **Tier 1: Core Storyline:** This tier focuses on the central narrative, its main characters (pre-defined Main Characters), and the key events driving the plot. Writers in this tier collaborate closely to ensure a coherent and engaging core narrative. The initial plot points and the general arc of the story are pre-determined by the Core Storyline Team.
	- **Tier 2: Secondary Storylines:** This tier expands the world around the main characters. Tier 1 writers work with other writers who take on Supporting Characters connected to their main character. Every Supporting Character must have a dedicated writer. This writer has the freedom to develop their character's life and personality, provided they maintain the pre-agreed relationship with their Tier 1 character and avoid any actions that would disrupt the Core Storyline.
	- **Tier 3: The World at Large:** This tier is the heart of Open World Stories. It offers boundless creative freedom and limitless possibilities. Writers create independent stories and characters that exist within the same shared world. They are the real world behind main story. As the characters exist in the world their stories intersect with other characters. Every scene is a collaboration between writers building a world for their characters to come alive in.

**Reader Experience:**

Open World Stories offers a unique and immersive reading experience:


- **Multiple Perspectives:** Experience the unfolding narrative and the world at large from countless viewpoints. Every character you encounter is a doorway to a new story.
- **A Living World:** Dive into a dynamic universe populated by individuals, each with their own motivations, secrets, and dreams. Every interaction, every chance encounter, could lead you down a rabbit hole into a completely new and unexpected story.
- **Choose Your Own Adventure:** Follow the main characters in the Core Storyline, explore the lives of those connected to them, or venture into the independent stories of the wider world. The choice is yours. You may find compelling stories without ever encountering the Core or Secondary storylines.

**Joining the World:**

To participate in Open World Stories, you will:


1. **Claim or Create a Character:**
	- **Tier 1 (Core Storyline):** Writers interested in portraying a pre-defined Main Character in the Core Storyline will undergo a selection process. This may involve submitting writing samples, outlining their vision for the character, and potentially participating in community voting. The Core Storyline Team will make the final selection, ensuring the writer is a good fit for the character and the collaborative nature of the project.
	- **Tier 2 (Secondary Storyline):** Tier 1 writers, in collaboration with the Core Storyline Team, may identify "character vacancies" for Supporting Characters within their storylines. Writers can express their interest in these roles, and the Tier 1 writer, potentially with input from the Core Storyline Team, will select the most suitable collaborator.
	- **Tier 3 (The World at Large):** Writers have complete freedom to create their own unique characters within this tier. Simply create a character profile and begin writing! Every named character, or character that interacts within a scene must have a dedicated writer.
2. **Develop Your Character:** Craft their backstory, personality, relationships, and ongoing narrative.
3. **Collaborate with Others:** Connect with fellow writers to weave your characters' stories together, creating a vibrant and interconnected world.
4. **Shape the Universe:** Your choices and actions will contribute to the ever-evolving tapestry of Open World Stories. The stories you create in Tier 3 are not just additions to the world; they *are* the world. Every character you introduce has the potential to become a major point of interest for readers, showcasing the interconnected nature of Open World Stories.

**Open World Stories is more than just a writing project; it's a community. It's a chance to connect with fellow writers, build a world together, and create a truly unique and unforgettable storytelling experience. Join us and bring your character to life!**

Jane Potter, she had abandoned her birth name Jane Guðbjørnsdatter, at the start of freshers’ week, it was such a relief to not have to carry the weight of everybody’s confusion. She felt some shame for abandoning her father by no longer using it, but then he had abandoned her a long time ago. 

There are many reasons women have issues with the whole concept of patriachal society. Jane’s was much simpler, she had to carry around this ridiculous name. It always gave her a sense of inner dread whenever there would be any reason for anyone to see her full name. 

So now she was heading towards the M25, with Lily Allen’s Fuck You playing as loudly as her little car’s speakers would play it trying to convince her slightly bruised heart that her (now ex) boyfriend was an asshole anyway. She was leaving him, and leaving Cambridge with all of her possessions stuffed into the back of her 2005 Volkswagen Polo. She was somewhat disappointed that not only did her entire life fit into her little car. But her entire life fitted into her little car with ease. A suitcase for clothes, her prettification shit (make up, hair dryer etc) and a couple of boxes of Knick-knacks. Well, there was also the A4 Manila envelope on the passenger seat containing her 1st in International Relations. She supposed that was quite a big thing. 

Behind the tears that were currently flowing more freely than the M25 ever had, she was excited to be going to Oakhaven. She had missed her Grampa, Grampa Potter, of course - who was intensely proud to see his name on her Cambridge University pass. 

 Her mind wandered to the other reason she was going to Oakhaven, to see John Doyle. The reason she had originally decided to send an application to Cambridge. The reason she had decided to study what she did. The reason she was on her way to her first interview with an actual paper. Albeit a shitty local paper, she knew with her degree she could probably get a placement at a national paper. But j wanted to interview her, and that was pretty damn cool. Or terrifying. 

She checked her face in the mirror, at some point she’d have to stop at some services and sort her face out. She should wait for a while though in case the tears made a reappearance. 

She did find it very peculiar that her interview was in the cafe that was once the hardware store that she spent so many hours in as a little girl helping her Grampa sort out tools and screws and other random hardware. Small world she guessed. “Wouldn’t like to paint it” her (ex) boyfriend whispered into the back of her mind. 

And back came the tears. 

A couple of hours later, she was cleaned up, and parking in the Cafe car park.

She paused before the cafe, nostalgia mingling with delight as she admired its transformed facade. Once a relic of days past, it now glowed in a harmonious blend of pastel greens and blues—a palette both gentle and bold. Perhaps it was the playful name, or the effervescent charm that radiated from every corner, but she couldn’t help feeling enchanted. After all, it was called The Happy Place.

She spotted John sitting by the window, a mess of papers across a double table. Curious, she altered her path so she could walk past the window and peek at what he was doing. It was difficult to pick out any detail, but she could see a newspaper cutting with something about a mayor, and a pile of financial records. “Hello corruption” she mused to herself. 

As she opened the door, a small bell above the door rang. “Of course” she smiled. John didn’t look up, he was engrossed in the financial reports.

She stood for a moment, deliberating whether to interrupt, and how. She checked her watch and realised she was a little early. Then got slightly flustered by the bell ringing, and realising she was in the way of the door. 

She excused herself as a tall, strongly featured young woman entered and made her way to the counter, leaning over to embrace the woman behind it. While waiting, her gaze settled on the woman managing the counter, remembering when her grandpa would stand in almost the exact same spot. She smiled again, unsure whether it was his memory, the warm nostalgia of being eight years old, or this woman’s infectious joy that had made the world so perfect right now. 

“Hi, I’m Alice, what can I get for you?” Alice’s voice took a moment to make its way through the contentment that Jane was feeling. 

“Sorry, I was…” Jane smiled and moved to the counter, suddenly wishing society allowed her to lean over and hug Alice. “Sorry, its been a while since I’ve been here” ok, now she was making it awkward, and needed to explain that “I used to come here when my Grampa ran the place” 

“Oh my! You must be Jane! I have heard so much about you” Alice put the cup down that she was holding, came around the counter, wrapped her arms around Jane and embraced her. “I can’t believe I finally get to meet you” 

Her embrace was warm and gentle, and firm. It was exactly, no, Precisely what she needed after the week that brought her here. She was also in a state of mild emotional overload. “Well, erm, yes, ok, thanks” She returned the embrace and just hung on for a while. 

The surreal moment eventually dissipated, and she was back to standing in front of a counter ordering coffee. Alice told her to take a seat and she’d bring it over. 

Which meant there was nothing else for it, it was time to go and meet her hero. 

She stood in front of his table for a moment, expecting that he’d look up. He didn’t. 

Ok, she’d have to speak, fine, she could manage this - “hi, john?” 

He looked up “yes?” 

She was slightly put out that he wasn’t expecting her. But he was working on a story, she figured he had to be somewhat compulsive to be as good as he was. “I’m here for the interview?”

“Oh yes! I’ve been reading your stuff, you’re good” John said. 

*You’ve been reading my stuff?* Oh my! John Doyle had read my stuff! Her mind proudly proclaimed. Quickly followed by Oh my! John Doyle has read my stuff. Suddenly all of the late night bad writing she’d done came back to assault her. Her reason stepped in to halt the panic. Of course he’s read my stuff, there’s a link to it on cover letter. Focus now, panic later, her reason instructed her. 

John made some comment about his editor being an arsehole. But was interrupted by Alice bringing her coffee. 

“Here you go, and make sure you come back for a chat, I’d love to get to know you a little” Alice said as she put her coffee down. She caught a girlish smile on the strongly featured woman as she made eye contact with Alice before she walked away. 

Jane straightened her cup, and pondered the arsehole comment a little “so John, what was the point in telling me that?” She immediately noticed John’s face change, there was a reaction there, though she couldn’t quite place what it was. Frustration? Anger? 

“Why did you use my name there Jane?” John asked

Jane hadn’t actually realised she’d used his name, she was nervous and her mind did weird things. “So is this the start of the interview? If so, then surely you know why, I’ve read your articles too, you’re good enough to know the reasons for these things” 

“Good enough? Really.” Jane felt a prickle of guilt. He'd paused to give it time to surface, and she knew it. “Ok, sure” he continued “Developing trust? Rapport? Make a connection?” 

 

He was mocking her, she recognised the tone from his writing. The look had also gone from his face, he was vaguely smiling again. She replied in kind, “no, of course not, I was mocking you” She hoped he didn’t have a fragile ego as she formed the words. 

He started asking her about a hypothetical case, of a story being blocked by an editor. A story about local government corruption. As he started talking about it she noticed the strongly featured woman to the side of him stop sketching in her book and start paying attention to the conversation. 

It was obviously whatever case he was currently working on, somewhere there was a mayor with some dubious financial records. 

She said what she thought, and the interview carried on for a while. At the end she told John she was going to be in town for a week or so, so if he wanted anything else she’d be happy to meet again. They shook hands and Jane left The Happy Place to go see her Grampa.

```md
John had been a journalist all of his life. At some point in his life he had written for all of the major newspapers in the UK. He was an investigative journalist during the phone hacking scandal and for the first time in his career he was ashamed to be in the business. 

He moved through a few jobs after that trying to find something that fulfilled him. Ultimately he settled for writing for a small newspaper that measured its readership in tens of thousands rather than millions. He still had some scope to do investigative journalism but he largely considered himself semi-retired and working on a book revealing the secrets of the industry. 

A few weeks before he had watched the mayor launching a new business development incentive. He had regurgitated the press release into an article and had asked around a little to better understand what it was. Over the years John had developed an ear for the words people use. He was never any good at body language etc, but he found that when someone was nervous, or evasive or in some way not being direct and honest then their language would very subtly change. 

As he watched the mayor’s speech he noticed he was lying. He tried to ignore his inner journalist waking up. That lasted almost twenty four hours, then he got to work digging into the project. 

The culmination of that work was a file he had sent to his boss / editor for review before he published. He was waiting in the local coffee shop for him to come talk to him. 

While he was waiting he chatted to Alice, asked how she was settling into married life. 

“Oh its amazing!” Said Alice, “I was worried that Sophie wouldn’t like living here away from the big city, and her family. But she’s loving it” 

“Her family are all law enforcement right? This must be quite a change” 

“Yeah, her father is like commissioner Gordon or something” 

John left a pause so Alice would continue talking. His pause was interrupted by a voice behind him. 

“Jamal, get me a coffee while you’re up there” Tom always used John’s native name, that John pretty much never used any more. He particularly disliked the way that he used it. It was a sign that they were both from ‘the old country’ Strangely he only ever mentioned the old country when he wanted something. Him using it as an opening meant that he was here to tell him he couldn’t run the story, and he wanted to be a buddy about it. 

Alice looked at him a little confused. “Jamal?” She had only ever known him as John. 

“A story for another day” he closed his eyes a little and waved his hand “make that two espressos please” 

“No worries” she smiled “go sit down, I’ll bring them over” 

“So I can’t run the story?” John said as he sat down 

“How do you do that? How do you always know what I’m about to say” 

“I’m not sure whether I told you, but I used to be a journalist” said half in jest, and three quarters caustically highlighting his disdain for the stories he had to write for the shitrag he currently had to write for. 

“Then you should know that you’ve not got it” Tom said. “Bring me some more, bring me some evidence that this is happening and you know I’ll support you.”

John stayed silent. 

“Look, some of my other businesses run almost exclusively on government money. I’m not going to attack these people unless it is solid”

John’s silence continued… 

“And this isn’t” 

At that moment, the bell on the door rang, and they were both distracted by the irrefutably fair Sophie entering the cafe and making a beeline to her new wife. They hug over the counter then she heads to the table along side John’s. 

“They’re corrupt Tom, its that simple” John always intentionally didn’t use Tom’s ‘old country name’ because he wasn’t his buddy, he was an employee, and all of his other employees called him Tom

“Come off it Jamal, everybody takes the occasional backhander, its how the world works” 

John saw Sophie lower her drawing pad a little. Tom was never very good at controlling the volume he spoke at. 

“This is a lot more than that, and you know it. They need to be held accountable” Knowing his words weren’t going to make any difference, but he was acutely aware that he had Sophie’s attention. 

“Find more, I can’t do anything with this” Tom held the folder in the air, then dropped it on the table. “And get your bloody car fixed, it is a pain in the arse driving all the way out here to you” 

With that he threw his espresso down and left. 

John took out his pocket book, looked at the remains in his cup, watched Alice until she saw him looking and waved his cup in the air to ask for a fresh cup. 

He updated his notes on the corruption case, detailing the conversation he’d just had. He looked at the folder, a flash of concern passed through his mind that Tom had removed something. So he took everything out and spread it across the table. Almost knocking his pocketbook onto the floor, he picked it up and put it on the chair next to his. 

Loathed to concede Tom’s point, he allowed the thought of whether there was enough to pursue the case in these files. 

He was so frustrated, and probably angry, at how the conversation transpired that he was completely shocked when a young woman came and asked if he was John. 

“Yes, what?” He knew he was pulling a confused face, but had no clue who she could be. “Sorry” he took a breath “who are you?” 

“I’m Jane Potter, you’re hopefully expecting me for an interview for the graduate journalist position?”

“Oh my! Yes of course, I got myself lost in a story, apologies” he started putting the papers together and pushing them into the folder. “I pulled your articles from your student paper, you write well”

He watched Jane blush a little. 

“Let me ask you” John said “was your editor an arsehole? Because all editors are arseholes” 

“Well thank you” Jane shyly said “But if I get this job, won’t you be my editor?” 

“Exactly my point” John smiled. “Anyway we should get started, do you want a drink?” He looked up to see Alice bringing a cup towards them. 

Jane thanked Alice, then looked directly at John “so, is there a story behind that point you just made John” 

“Tell me why you used my name when you asked that Jane” 

“Is that where we’re starting? Surely you know why, I’ve pulled your articles too, you’re very good” Jane said with her very best straight poker face. 

“So, establishing rapport? Developing trust, make me your buddy so I’ll open up” 

“No” she said in a derisory tone. “I was mocking you, obviously”. A moment later she added “I thought somebody with your experience would have known that” 

John leaned back in his seat, let out an audible exaggerated “Ha!” And smiled. 

“Yes Jane, this is exactly where we’re starting. Now let me ask you a hypothetical” 

He asked about what she would do if she had evidence of corruption that her editor wouldn’t allow her to publish. 

She laid out the options exactly as he saw them. 

Retrench, find more evidence. Make the story better. 

Go around the editor, is there an owner of the paper. Maybe go to a different paper with the story. 

Take the evidence to the police. Use that investigation to get the scoop. 

Use a contact to pursue the above, if the usual channels don’t work. 

The interview lasted for thirty or so minutes. He was impressed by her. She certainly had a quality. 

All of the contacts he could think of he’d either burnt, they’d died, or it was just too damn long ago to cal in the favours. 

So he’d just have to retrench. He put the folder into his bag and left to go to his home office and get to work. 

As he stood up he accidentally knocked the chair next to him into Sophie. He nodded his head towards her, apologised and left before she could respond.
